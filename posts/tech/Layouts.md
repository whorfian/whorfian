# Keyboard Layouts

First, a tangent. Why care about typing? 

If you're at a computer a lot and plan to be for the next few decades, then being proficient at it is probably a good investment of your time. I commonly hear from people "I'm slowed down by my thinking, not my typing" both in regards to typing languages like English or typing code. I don't believe this at all, and I think it's just a lie we tell ourselves. English could require 100x more characters to express the same amount of **information** and people would still say this. Once you learn to type faster, you'll find that it's very liberating to your creativity. You can get thoughts out at a much more comfortable speed. Spending 10-20 minutes a day practicing typing can be a great investment in your future productivity. 

This isn't the only reason to care about typing. Some people are more into speed typing for the competition. They enjoy it and want to improve at it. It being a valuable skill is more of a bonus.

Next, do layouts matter? 

By and large, most of the achievements in typing have been held by qwerty users. There is some presence from people using alt layouts, but speed typing is dominated by qwerty pretty heavily. For the few alt users there are, people usually attribute their skill to their higher than average practice time - not their layout. 

What can we make of this? 

An alt layout does not make you an elite performer. An alt layout does not make your fingers move faster. An alt layout doesn't let you catch up to the massive population of qwerty users that have years or decades of experience with their layout. 

I state this obvious fact because it's still a myth people have to refute. There are young, impressionable kids that find videos showcasing someone typing fast with another layout and think that switching to that layout will let them type fast. People are hitting 250+ wpm on qwerty; your layout is not limiting you. 

---

Okay, so what's the point of a layout? 

You can appreciate that qwerty isn't limiting you while also disliking how it feels to use it. If you're going to be doing a lot of typing, then it should be enjoyable, right? If qwerty feels good to you and you're a fast typist, that's fine; you don't need to use an alt layout. 

I didn't care about layouts at all until I got into practicing typing in college. When I took my first few tests, I was getting 70-80 wpm on 10FF. After 6 months or so I had worked up to ~140 wpm and could repeat paragraph length quotes until I could get them at 170+. Because of the crazy-impressive typists I've seen, I know this isn't fast, but it was fast enough for me to start noticing things I disliked about qwerty, or, rather, what I disliked about the way I *used* qwerty. 

While trying to go faster, I was being bugged by lots of words that just *felt* **horrible**. I had learned standard homerow in middle school and had never implemented any kind of alt fingering or thought about how I should type different words more optimally (more on this in a second). Realizing why some words sucked and others didn't resulted in me joining the MonkeyType discord, eventually asking for a layouts channel to be created, and starting discussions on alternative layouts with other users.

Is the layout the problem or are you?

Raw speed in typing (as well as comfort) has a lot to do with technique. One of the easiest ways to improve both comfort and eventually speed is to improve technique.

I did this by introducing alt fingerings. This means you change what finger you use for a key based on the context: the keys before and after. Tons of fast typists do this intuitively and don't think much of it. Some do it a ton. Some barely do it at all. There are enough fast typists that *don't* do it that I don't think you could argue that it's a requirement for high speed; it just makes typing flow much more naturally.

If you alt finger a lot with qwerty, I think you can circumvent its worst issue: consecutive finger usage. Consecutive finger usage comes up a lot in qwerty: `sw ed ec fr gr tr br rv hu hy ny my nu mu ju ki lo`, etc. as well as their reverses. Some of these may already not be a problem for you because you implement a common alt fingering of some type. Ex: many people use left index for c, either index for b, either index for y, right middle for u, etc. 

These pairs of letters are called Same Finger Bigrams (SFBs), and I think the most important ones to eliminate are the ones greater than 1U in distance: things like `my`, `ny`, `nu`, `br`, etc.. You can try to alt finger things like `ik` or `lo` but it can be uncomfortable to angle your hands or fingers like this. I try to implement as many alt fingerings as I can, but I just can't comfortably implement either of these, so words like `follow`, `school`, or `look` essentially bottleneck me to the speed of a single finger. MonkeyType's word speed feature shows that while I type most words at 170-280 wpm (individually), I rarely type these words much faster than 150 wpm. If you're trying to set records on a very short test or text, then these types of bottlenecks can feel pretty limiting and are a weird disruption to flow. 

An issue with alt fingering is that you can end up tying your fingers in knots. There are lots of situations where alt fingering one key can force you to alt finger another key. I could list these all day; the more you alt finger, the more this happens. You have to develop a super dynamic style in which any finger needs to feel comfortable pressing any key near it, but you can run out of fingers. As a contrived example of this, imagine typing the word `mycelium` in which you use the common alt fingerings I listed above. You typically type `my` with RI LI, but then there's a `c` which you normally type with LI. You could hit it with LM but then there's an `e` which you typically hit with `LM`! After that there's also `lium`. If you're used to typing `mu`/`um` with RM for `u`, then you'd use middle for both `i` and `u`. Should you use ring for `u`?? Avoiding SFBs is creating SFBs!

Imagine overcomplicating typing to this degree ... I strongly recommend getting rid of just the long SFBs, but you'll still run into these situations somewhat frequently. If you run into them enough, alt fingering can feel like more of an impediment to your speed than a benefit. 

Another great way of avoiding SFBs is by having a low profile keyboard. A common favorite in the typing community is the apple magic. You can slide combinations like `ik`, `ol`, `fr`, etc. very easily. If you don't want to learn alt fingering for 1U SFBs, this can be just as good if not better.

I've created a few well-received keyboard layouts, but I don't use any of them. I stick to qwerty and do the shenanigans described above because I enjoy it. I also just enjoy creating layouts more than I enjoy the excruciating process of learning them, and I'm not *quite* ready to commit to anything.  

However, the layout community is thriving and full of people who really enjoy the process of creating, discussing, and learning new layouts. I even hosted and funded a tournament to see who could get the fastest on a brand new layout within a month: 120+ wpm on a long, complicated test! People in these layout communities can pick up something they've never used before and get up to their previous speed incredibly quickly - sometimes in just 2-3 weeks!

If you'll be at a keyboard for the next few decades, then crafting something specific to what you enjoy makes a lot of sense, especially if (1) you can learn it relatively quickly and (2) you won't have to deal with qwerty keyboards much for school or work. The layouts I and others have created lower SFB count so drastically that alt fingering isn't really necessary. They also optimize for lots of other things: 

**Maximizing rolls**: 
A layout with high rolling implies that most words will consist of 2-3 characters per hand at a time. This can feel both comfy and fast. Examples of this in qwerty are words like: `life`, `power`, `atom`, etc. Because I alt finger things like `tr`, `fr`, and `ju`, I also get more *rollable* words: `trim`, `from`, `just`, etc. 

**Minimizing *semi*-consecutive finger usage**:
A layout that minimizes both SFB and SFS (Same Finger Skipgrams) (or DSFB (Disjointed Same Finger Bigram) but this is a worse term) guarantees that the letters in a word will use more unique fingers. This means that more words are *chordable*. With my qwerty style, `around` is a good example of this. All letters use a unique finger, so with the correct technique I can type `around` almost instantly with a coordinated slap of the keyboard. 

**Minimizing distance**: 
Pretty straightforward, but people usually implement this incorrectly for some reason. Distance isn't just about the usage of a key and its distance from resting position; it's contextual. You want to guarantee that after pressing a key your finger won't have to travel a long distance to press the next key. An example of this is `vest` in qwerty. The transition from `v` to `t` is long and an analyzer should penalize it proportional to the number of characters separating the `v` and `t`. Distances of 2U+ are horrible for consecutive keys, bad for semi-consecutive keys, and then the importance of them drops off from there. However, this is personal and up to how *you* choose to weight things. Choosing to care about distances that are separated by many characters probably wouldn't affect a layout's potential for high speeds but it will affect the overall distance your fingers will be traveling while you type. 

**Minimizing lateral stretches**:
If you aren't alt fingering, then positions like `be` in qwerty are pretty uncomfortable to type with standard fingering. This stretch between your index and middle finger is called an LSB (Lateral Stretch Bigram). Minimizing this on layouts is entirely about comfort. I hate these stretches so prefer to minimize them. This depends on the stagger of your layout.

## Beyond Arrangement
There are other metrics to consider when deciding how to arrange your 3x10 (NxM, whatever) grid of letters, but you'll still end up with just a standard typing system. 

A standard typing system can benefit greatly from some minor quality-of-life improvements. My two favorites are one shot modifiers and repeat key. These are possible with software but easier and more reliable with firmware like QMK. Implementing them is up to you. 

One Shot Shift omits the need to hold down shift in order to capitalize something. You tap shift and whether it releases before the next key or after doesn’t matter. You can treat it just like any other key now. No more typing 'tHe' or 'THe'! I prefer implementations of this that only allow to you capitalize exactly one character. 

Repeat Key repeats whatever key you just typed. This means the worst offender of SFB count, double letters, are no longer a bottleneck in speed. Words like `look` now become `lo<rep>k`. It might seem overkill but you quickly get used to it and it's great for keeping a steady pace. There are actually more double letters than SFBs in optimized layouts, so technically this matters more for preserving flow than a layout's SFB minimization. Even more words can now be typed instantly with the proper technique, ex: `too`, `see`, `feel`, `week`, `meet`, `book`, `took`, `room`, `good`, `less`, `odd`, `add`, etc., etc., etc.

Both of these are great to have on the opposite thumb that presses space. You have 10 fingers; use em!

First, a small rant. 

Sometimes when I describe more niche typing systems, I get people who don't know me saying, "That sounds like steno. Hey, you should check out steno." when I am not describing steno.  
When I talk about taipo, a chording system I made that's symmetric, rhythmic, and generally good at typing anything, people say it's like steno.   
When I talk about disambiguation engines for chording with normal keyboards, people say it's like steno.   
When I mention using a context engine to make use of and predict text based on a minimized version of English phonemes, people say it's like steno. Hey, checkout steno.  
There are many colors to the rainbow, and people keep telling me the color red exists. I know the color red exists. Just because something involves chords or the word "phoneme" that doesn't mean I have reinvented steno.

Chord Disambiguation: I plan on writing more about this, and on creating software that lets you easily use it with any layout, keymap, or OS, but here's the basic idea.

A surprisingly large amount of English can be discerned from just the letters that make up the word. For instance, on qwerty, with my style, `because` uses all unique fingers, and there aren't any other *popular* words which use the same unique characters, so if the user slaps all those letters at the same time, just output `because`! If a word requires multiple chords, as in it uses the same finger twice, then you can chain these slaps together. When you combine a chord with something like a space, period, comma, etc., the program knows you're done chording the word and will output the result. 

I'll update this later with some of the more exact stats, but over 80-90% of English can be typed this way and (iirc) most chords are 3-4 keys in length. You'll still need to type lots of proper nouns out manually, and the software has no idea whether you're trying to type things like `who` or `how` (depending on the layout), so it's not perfect, but getting to intuitively chord 80+% of text? That's a pretty big boost to speed with none of the learning curve of steno. You're still just typing the characters you see. You chord all of them up until you need to use a finger again (except for repeats), then you do a new chord. 

If two words have the same input (anagrams if they're just one chord), then you can handle this a few different ways, but no matter what this *will* have a bit of a learning curve. A user won't know if chording `who` will give them `who` or `how` and they'll have to remember that. Whether you force them to type out the conflict manually or have an additional key that outputs (or lets you toggle through) alternatives to chords could be an option in the software.

I'll add other things or edits later. I am sleepy.
